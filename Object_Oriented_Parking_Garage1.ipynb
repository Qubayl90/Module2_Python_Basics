        "- takeTicket\n",
        "- This should decrease the amount of tickets available by 1\n",
        "- This should decrease the amount of parkingSpaces available by 1\n",
        "- payForParking\n",
        "- Display an input that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable\n",
        "- If the payment variable is not empty then (meaning the ticket has been paid) -> display a message to the user that their ticket has been paid and they have 15mins to leave\n",
        "- This should update the \"currentTicket\" dictionary key \"paid\" to True\n",
        "-leaveGarage\n",
        "- If the ticket has been paid, display a message of \"Thank You, have a nice day\"\n",
        "- If the ticket has not been paid, display an input prompt for payment\n",
        "- Once paid, display message \"Thank you, have a nice day!\"\n",
        "- Update parkingSpaces list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the parkingSpaces list)\n",
        "- Update tickets list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the tickets list)\n",
        "\n",
        "You will need a few attributes as well:\n",
        "- tickets -> list\n",
        "- parkingSpaces -> list\n",
        "- currentTicket -> dictionary\n",
